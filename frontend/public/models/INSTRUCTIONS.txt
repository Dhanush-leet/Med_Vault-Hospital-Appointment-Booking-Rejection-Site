IMPORTANT: 3D Model Assets Required

To enable the full 3D interactive experience, please download the following models and place them in this directory (`frontend/public/models/`).

1. **Heart Model**
   - Search for: "Human Heart GLB" (e.g. from Sketchfab, Poly Pizza)
   - Filename: `heart.glb`

2. **Brain Model**
   - Search for: "Human Brain GLB"
   - Filename: `brain.glb`

3. **DNA Model**
   - Search for: "DNA Helix GLB"

Ensure the files are valid `.glb` (binary glTF) files. 
If the models fail to load, the application will show a loading state or fallback.
